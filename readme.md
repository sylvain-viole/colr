# COLR

**Colr is a simple code formater project.**

## Project :
It takes any targeted DOM content, matches it with regexp, applies style and injects it back.

![colr example 1](https://github.com/sylvavio/colr/blob/main/examples/colr-example-1.png)

Right now it handles JS and PHP partially.
Its a work in progress.

#

## HOW TO :
- add "colr.css" and "colr.js" to project,
- link files to page,
- add "colr-container" class to whatever DOM element you want to format,
- add "pre class="colr" inside the colr-container,
- Write code inside
- :)

#

## Limitations :
- Only tested on JS and some PHP right now

#

## KNOWN ISSUES
- Multi line comment not supported
- regexp lookarounds not supported
