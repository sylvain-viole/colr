# COLR

**Colr is a simple code colorizer project.**

## Project :
It takes any targeted DOM content, matches it with regexp, applies style and injects it back.

Right now it handles only JS partially.
Its a work in progress.

#

## HOW TO :
- add "colr.css" and "colr.js" to project,
- link files to page,
- add "colr" class whatever DOM element you want to scan ("pre" is recommended),

#

## Limitations :
- Only parses JS right now

#

## KNOWN ISSUES
- Multi line comment not supported
- regexp lookarounds not supported
